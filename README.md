## What's The Deal With This?

I'm currently reading Sandi Metz's brilliant book: *Practical Object-Oriented
Design in Ruby*.It's a lot of fun and really informative. However, there's so
much good information in the book that I really felt the need to create a repo
of the lessons and examples in the book that stick out the most to *me*.
Hopefully they might help you out a lot as well!
