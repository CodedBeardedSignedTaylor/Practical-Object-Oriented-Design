## What's The Deal With This?

I'm currently reading Sandi Metz's brilliant book: *Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby*.
It's a lot of fun and really informative. However, there's so much good information in the book
that I really felt the need to create a repo of the lessons and examples in the book that stick out
the most to *me*. Hopefully they might help you out a lot as well!
